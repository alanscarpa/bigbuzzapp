  - Notifications
    (q) - I think we only only send 1 daily reminder that there is a new question.  I don't think we send a "Results are in" push.  Up for debate though.  
    (q) - At what point in the flow do we ask for notification permission?
    [] - Set up notifications
       (q) - Local or remote?  I think Local because then everyday at 9am? 2pm? whenever - the user will get a push saying, "Hey check out the latest question in big buzz!". The downside is, if we don't have a questino up, this notification will still happen.  The remote notifications would require us to log in to Firebase everyday, and write out our notification and send manually.  I vote for local, automatic notifications for simplicity;s sake.
